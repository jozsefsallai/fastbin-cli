**To upload the contents of a file:**

```
fastbin-cli file.txt
```

**To upload the output of a command:**

```
ls -ag | fastbin-cli
```

**To upload a file and only print and copy the full URL:**

```
fastbin-cli --full file.txt
```

**To upload a file and only print and copy the raw URL:**

```
fastbin-cli --raw file.txt
```

## Installation

### Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Windows

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/jozsefsallai/fastbin-cli/releases) for your operating system and architecture. For easy access, you should place the downloaded executable somewhere inside your PATH (and maybe even rename it too, if you want).

### Go

You can also download a binary using `go get`:

```
go get github.com/jozsefsallai/fastbin-cli
```

## Configuration

You can use the built-in `init` command to initialize your environment settings.

```
fastbin-cli init
```

It will prompt you for the URL of the fastbin server you want to use and the private access key of the fastbin server (if it's not a public server). The settings will be stored in `~/.fastbinrc.json`. You can also create this file yourself, based on the [example](https://github.com/jozsefsallai/fastbin-cli/blob/master/.fastbinrc.example.json).
